SVG placeholder - You should replace this with actual PNG icons
For now, create a 192x192px icon with your app branding.
Recommended: Use a tool like https://realfavicongenerator.net/ or create in design software.

The icon should feature:
- Purple/gradient background (#667eea to #764ba2)
- A journal/book symbol or the letter "M"
- Clean, simple design that scales well
